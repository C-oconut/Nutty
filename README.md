# Nutty

A small, yet easily hackable coding language.

# Introduction
Nutty is a developmental language used to make the process of coding a tad bit easier. 
Since its built using Python, Nutty can execute Python aswell as its own native language.
Its also modular! This means you can use a variety of python or nutty based APIs with it including
the standard library Nutty runs on. Due to its ability to be lightweight, it has little to no security. 

# Requirements
- Install the latest version of Python. https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/
- Install Nutty's zip file and extract it your desktop. The shell is located in Bin folder.

*Fully functional, however was meant as a joke. Hence the name and the file extension*
*Inspired by a youtube series (could no longer find the series on youtube)*
