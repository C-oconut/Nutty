# Nutty

A small, yet easily hackable coding language.

# Introduction
Nutty is a developmental language used to make the process of coding a tad bit easier. 
Since its built using Python, Nutty can execute Python aswell as its own native language.
Its also modular! This means you can use a variety of python or nutty based APIs with it including
the standard library Nutty runs on. Due to its ability to be lightweight, it has little to no security. 

# FAQ
  Why a new language?
    - I felt that many people didnt persue coding because of its complexity in most areas. 
    By making it easier to learn, maybe more people could find the joy in it.
  
  Why from scratch?
    - Why not be original? 
  
  When will you create the wiki?
    - When time allows.

# Requirements
- Install the latest version of Python. https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/
- Install Nutty's zip file and extract it your desktop. The shell is located in Bin folder.
