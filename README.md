# Nutty

A new language that simplifies Python

# Introduction
Nutty is a developmental language used to make the process of coding on python easier. 
Since its built using Python, Nutty can execute Python aswell as its own native language. 
Due to its ability to be lightweight, it has little to no security. 

# FAQ
  Why a new language?
    - I felt that many people didnt persue coding because of its complexity in most areas. 
    By making it easier to learn, maybe more people could find the joy in it.
  
  Why from scratch?
    - Why not be original? 
  
  When will you create the wiki?
    - When Nutty can execute a print statement.

# Statement
As of 11/9/16, Nutty is a work in progress. Nothing is completed. Ill keep you updated though! :)
